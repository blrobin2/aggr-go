# aggr-go

Aggregates album reviews from across the web


## About
[aggr](https://aggr.live/) is a site I maintain that collects music reviews from various
sources based on certain conditions and generates a feed of albums to discover.

I've written the code that actually fetches the reviews in multiple languages as a means of learning the language:
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/blrobin2/aggr)
* [Haskell](https://github.com/blrobin2/aggr-haskell)

This version is written in [Go](https://golang.org/)
